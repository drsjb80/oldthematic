 ### Known Outstanding issues ###
 * **BUGS**
   * they are there... find them!
 * **Feature Loss Due to Framework Limitations**
   * Icons on the menus (Waiting on further implementation of the management API)
   * Automatically updating menus when themes are added or removed (Waiting on further implementation of the management API)
   * Ability to change the shortcut keys (??? No indication of if/when this will be supported)
   * Main menu ...menu (??? No indication of if/when this will be supported)
   * Toolbar height adjustment (??? No indication of if/when this will be supported)
   * Mouse over preview on the Tools submenu (Currently impossible, as far as I can tell, as there does not seem to be a way to get a reference to the menu object in order to add an event listener to it. No indication that Mozilla is even considering making this possible)
 * **Linux:** ??Ubuntu version 17.04 is not displaying the theme icons in the menus.?? -Unable to verify at present
 * **Localization** 
   * Many non-english translations are either incomplete or still using english placeholder text.
   * messages.json files need to be fully alphabetized for consistency and ... sanity ...
* **Testing:**   Tests need to be updated to be compatible with the WebExtensions framework or new tests need to be developed.
